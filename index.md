I am Egemen and what I do is curating plots out of observations. My efforts are
concentrated on excavating structured information out of partially observable
systems with many subparts interacting in a nonlinear fashion (complex systems).
You can find about who I am, what I like and where I love in the About section.
For projects focused on Data Science and Machine Intelligence please visit the Blog section.
