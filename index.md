    # Finding patterns in observations to extract information
---

I am Egemen and what I do is curating plots out of observations. My efforts are
concentrated on excavating structured information out of partially observable
systems with many subparts interacting in nonlinear fashion (complex systems).
My search for patterns is not constrained by a school. I believe real life systems
assert flexibility in tools to understand them in more depth. Thereby, I do not
define myself as a Machine Learning researcher, Network Scientist or an EE guy
looking for signals to convolve.
